This is an interpreter for a simple imperative language, written in Haskell. I was motivated by the CS 146 course at the University of Waterloo, but didn't start this project until later.

This interpreter can be built using the GHC Compiler, with the command ghc --make Interpreter. Programs are read from stdin.

sampleProgram contains a simple program which evaluates 10! when read by the interpreter.
